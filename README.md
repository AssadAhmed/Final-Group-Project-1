This repository contains our final group project. the data used within the project is contained within the data folder. please see the final_group_project.RMD file in the session 10 folder to view our analysis on credit card fraud. We analysis a dataset of transaction of instances of legal and illegal card transactions/ Through exploratory analysis we clean the data and fir 5 different types of models (logistic regression,decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, K nearest neighbours) to try and predict instances of credit card fraud with a greater degree of accuracy than a naive model (assuming all transaction are not fraud).
Our analysis determines that XGBoost is the best fitting model in terms of accuracy and computation time and is the best model to use for rpedicting credit card fraud base don the data set used.
